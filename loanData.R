#Does the term of the loan influence loan status? If so, how?

#III 
#The news just ran a story that only 15% 
#of homes are fully paid for in America,
#and that another 10% have given up on paying it back, 
#so the bank has "charged off" the loan.
#Does it seem likely that the data for this hands on came from the larger population of America?
